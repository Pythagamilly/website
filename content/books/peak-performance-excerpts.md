# Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success
## Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness

### Intense stress then recovery
* this cycle of stress and rest is often referred to as periodization.
* if after the stressful period you give your body time to rest and recover, it adapts and becomes stronger, allowing you to push a little harder in the future.
* The best athletes also prioritize recovery, time on the couch and in bed, just as much as they prioritize time on the track or in the gym.
* The days, weeks, months, years, and entire careers of master athletes represent a continual ebb and flow between stress and rest.
* "The leaps and bounds I’ve made over the last several years have come from outside the training environment and how I choose to recover,”
* How you treat yourself in between workouts is where you make gains and acquire the strength to attack the next one.”
* she recovers: the 10 to 12 hours of sleep she gets each night; her meticulous approach to diet; her weekly massage and stretching sessions. In other words, it’s all the things she does when she isn’t training that allows her to do what she does when she is.
* Kenyan runners spent a majority of their training time running at a snail’s pace. When he revisited the research, Seiler also saw it mentioned that the Kenyans alternated between very hard days and very easy days.
* Csikszentmihalyi found that the same held true for creative geniuses: the brightest minds spend their time either pursuing an activity with ferocious intensity, or engaging in complete restoration and recovery.
* Csikszentmihalyi documented a common process across almost all great intellectual and creative performers, regardless of their field: 1.Immersion: total engagement in their work with deep, unremitting focus 2.Incubation: a period of rest and recovery when they are not at all thinking about their work 3.Insight: the occurrence of “aha” or “eureka” moments—the emergence of new ideas and growth in their thinking
* Determine when your work regularly starts to suffer. When you find that point, insert a recovery break just prior to it.

### Mental energy is like physical energy, it is limited
* Participants who were forced to flex their mental muscle—be it to resist temptation, solve a hard puzzle, or make tough decisions—performed worse on a subsequent task that also required mental energy as compared to participants in a control group who had an easy first task, like eating fresh cookies.
* It seems we have a single reservoir of brainpower for all acts of cognition and self-control, even those that are unrelated.
* When shown a tempting image, such as a juicy cheeseburger, or asked to solve a hard problem, activity in parts of the brain associated with emotional response (the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) supersede activity in the part of the brain tasked with thoughtful, rational thinking (the prefrontal cortex).
* Much like how after you’ve lifted weights to the point of fatigue your arms won’t function very well, after you’ve used your mind to the point of fatigue—be it to resist temptation, make tough decisions, or work on challenging cognitive tasks—it, too, won’t function very well.
* The good news is that just like the body, by stressing and allowing the mind to recover it also becomes stronger.
* Waitzkin attributes much of his success in both chess and tai chi to alternating between stress and rest: There was more than one occasion that I got up from the board four or five hours into a hugely tense chess game, walked outside the playing hall and sprinted fifty yards or up six flights of stairs. Then I’d walk back, wash my face, and be completely renewed. To this day, virtually every element of my physical training also revolves around one form or another of stress and recovery

### Stress over time == growth
* Stress can be positive, triggering desirable adaptations in the body; or stress can be negative, causing grave damage and harm.
* Growth comes at the point of resistance; we learn by pushing ourselves to the outer reaches of our abilities.
* science shows that learning demands open-ended exploration that allows students to reach beyond their individual limits.
* students who were forced to struggle on complex problems before receiving help from teachers outperformed students who received immediate assistance.
* Growth comes at the point of resistance. Skills come from struggle.
* “During training, I seek out and try to ride waves that scare me,”
* Being uncomfortable is the path to personal development and growth. It is the opposite of complacency.”
* As we work more at something, more myelin is generated, and that enables electrical activity to travel more fluidly between neurons. In other words, the connections in our brain strengthen. Over time, our former struggles become second nature.
* Just like struggling to eke out one last repetition in the weight room is a great method for growing the body, struggling to the point of failure and only then receiving assistance is a great recipe for growing the mind.
* Fail productively: Only seek out support after you’ve allowed yourself to struggle.
* When the task at hand is a bit beyond your skills you’re in the sweet spot. Any less of a challenge and you’d feel like “I’ve got this in the bag.” It’d be too easy and not stressful enough to serve as a stimulus for growth.
* Think of a skill/capability that you want to grow. Assess your current ability to perform this skill/capability. Actively seek out challenges that just barely exceed your ability. If you feel fully in control, make the next challenge a bit harder. If you feel anxious or so aroused that you can’t focus, dial things down a notch.
* Ericsson found experience and expertise did not necessarily go hand in hand.
* The best violinists spent significantly more time intensely focused on mastering a specific goal, and remained totally present when doing so. They eliminated all distractions. They rarely, if ever, merely went through the motions. The best violinists were practicing, as Ericsson and his team coined it, far more “deliberately” than everyone else.
* Practice doesn’t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.
* What really differentiates deliberate practice is deep concentration.
* It was just the three of us discussing this book. The energy was palpable. He gave us the same attention he gives to the president of the United States. Dr. Bob was fully present. We were witnessing in real time his secret to success. 
* By doing one thing at a time and devoting his full concentration to that one thing, Dr. Bob is able to do many things well—from writing and influencing health care policy, to investing in companies, to being a good husband and father. 
* His insistence on single-tasking ensures that he learns and grows from every document he drafts and every interaction he’s involved in.


### Multitasking doesn't work - focus on one task instead
* As a result, as countless studies show, the quality and, ironically, even the quantity of our work suffers when we are multitasking.
* Researchers at the University of Michigan found that seemingly innocuous multitasking can cannibalize as much as 40 percent of someone’s productive time.
* Define a purpose and concrete objectives for each working session. Ask yourself: What do I want to learn or get done? 
* Focus and concentrate deeply, even if doing so isn’t always enjoyable. •Single-task: The next time you feel like multitasking, remind yourself that research shows it’s not effective. Keep in mind Dr. Bob’s secret: “Do only one thing at a time.” •Remember that quality trumps quantity.
* Unlike other neurochemicals that are released when we’ve achieved something, the far more potent dopamine is released prior to the payoff of an event, when we are longing for or desiring something deeply. In other words, we don’t become addicted to winning; we become addicted to the chase.
* the brain rewards us with more dopamine for the act of seeking a reward than for the act of receiving one.
* a good portion of it instead goes toward thinking about checking your phone, imagining what might be awaiting you on it, and restraining yourself from actually checking.
* Mischel has found that one of the best methods for self-control is to move the object of desire out of view.
* This objective data supported what he subjectively experienced. Without his smartphone visible, Brad quickly forgot about its existence. He felt as if he had another 10 to 15 percent of effort to give to the task at hand.
* Ericsson found that top performers across all fields are unable to sustain intense work and deep concentration for more than 2 hours.

### Growth mindset - stress == growth
* The lens through which we view the world affects everything from learning to health to longevity to our hormonal response to “different” milkshakes.
* although all the students started from the same measurable baseline, those with growth mindsets progressed significantly faster than their fixed-mindset peers.
* Culture has conditioned us to minimize stress and avoid it at all costs. For the unfortunate times when we can’t avoid stress, we are given “coping” techniques or strategies to “get through it” so that we can “minimize the damage.”
* A 2010 study found that the small portion of Americans who view stress as facilitative have a 43 percent lower chance of premature death than those who view stress as destructive.
* The Upside of Stress, a book that challenged the prevailing wisdom on stress. She discovered a large body of evidence showing that how we view stress weighs heavily on how stress influences us.
* DHEA has been linked to a reduced risk of anxiety, depression, heart disease, neurodegeneration, and a range of other diseases and conditions. DHEA is also a neurosteroid, which helps the brain grow. When under stress, you want to release more DHEA than cortisol.

### It is not stress it is excitement
* The elites, on the other hand, interpreted the stress and the sensations that came with it as an aid to their performance; it prepared them to get the most out of their bodies.
* When you try to suppress pre-event nerves, you are inherently telling yourself that something is wrong. Not only does this make the situation worse, but it also takes emotional and physical energy to fight off the feeling of anxiety
* Fortunately, according to the authors of this paper, simply telling yourself “I am excited” shifts your demeanor from what they call a threat mindset (stressed out and apprehensive) to an opportunity mindset
* In a paradoxical twist, the second half of the growth equation, rest, can be even harder.
* Remember the power of mindset: How you view something fundamentally changes how your body responds to it. In situations when you feel the sensation of stress, remind yourself this is your body’s natural way of preparing for a challenge; take a deep breath and channel the heightened arousal and sharper perception toward the task at hand.
* Challenge yourself to view stress productively, and even to welcome it. You’ll not only perform better, you’ll also improve your health.

### Rest and mindfulness 
* Stephen King, “For me, not working is the real work.”
* Like the early Googlers, Rennels simply couldn’t turn it off. But, he says, “That all changed when I got serious about mindfulness.”
* His mind still raced at work and when he was actively problem-solving, but he was able to quiet it at the end of the day. He listened better, and he slept better, too.
* Mindfulness is about being completely present in the moment, fully aware of yourself and your surroundings. It’s helpful to think of the meditation part as highly specific training for being more present at all times of your life. 
* When you meditate, you are strengthening your mindful muscle.
* just a few minutes every day, mindfulness meditation increases gray matter in the part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex.
* A weak prefrontal cortex gets overpowered by a strong stress response. But a strong prefrontal cortex lets us choose how we want to respond to stress.
* It was as if they felt the pain, thought, “Ouch, that hurts,” and then consciously chose not to react any further. There was no amygdala hijack inside the brains of the expert meditators.
* It’s not that elite runners don’t feel pain and discomfort during their hard workouts, it’s just that they react differently. 
* Rather than panicking, they have in their minds what Steve calls a “calm conversation.” The calm conversation goes something like this: “This is starting to hurt now. It should. I’m running hard. But I am separate from this pain. It is going to be okay.”
* When it started to get really difficult, I didn’t try to force my way through the pain or fight against it. Instead, I reminded myself this is normal and I relaxed.”
* Frequency trumps duration. It’s best to meditate daily, even if that means keeping individual sessions short. •Apply your growing mindfulness abilities in everyday life. 
* Have “calm conversations” during stressful periods.

### Taking breaks for creativity
* Our most profound ideas often come from the small spaces in between otherwise deliberate thinking: when our brains are at rest.
* Researchers have found that despite spending the vast majority of our waking hours in effortful thought, over 40 percent of our creative ideas manifest during breaks.
* “It’s almost like the sole reason you do the work is to set the stage for what happens when you step away.”
* When you are working on a strenuous mental task and hit an impasse, stop working. Step away from whatever it is you are doing for at least 5 minutes. 
* The more stressful the task, the longer your break should be. 
* For really draining tasks, consider stepping away until the next morning. 
* During your breaks, if you aren’t sleeping (more on this soon), perform activities that demand little to no effortful thinking.
* You may have an “aha” moment of insight during your break. If you do, great. Even if you don’t have an “aha” moment during your break, your subconscious mind is still at work. When you return to whatever it is you were doing, you’ll be more likely to make progress.

### Sleep for better performance
* The ratio of the hormones testosterone to cortisol acts as a good indicator of systemic recovery (the higher this ratio, the better). 
* A study out of Bangor University in the UK found this ratio was higher in athletes who went through their post-game analysis in a social environment with friends than in athletes who went through it in a neutral environment with strangers. What’s more is that the group in the social environment actually performed better in competition a week later.
* If an institution with one of the best combination of athletes and researchers in the entire world says we should sleep more to improve our physical performance, then perhaps we should listen.
* You can’t nap your way to growth, be it physical or psychological. That said, napping does help restore energy and concentration during midday lulls, so it’s a strategy worth considering for long and intense days.
* sleep scientists found that a 10-minute nap yields the greatest benefits, though most experts say anything under 30 minutes is effective. 
* Even if you don’t actually experience the sensation of falling asleep, simply closing your eyes can help switch your active brain off, allowing it to recover. 
* Staying asleep for more than 30 minutes, however, can be counterproductive. This is because with longer naps we run the risk of waking up feeling even groggier and more sluggish than before we fell asleep.
* Don’t fight fatigue! Rather, use this time for recovery and to generate creative ideas that you can act on during your next cycle of high energy and focus.

### Mental states and the zone
* In order to give it our all, and do so over a long time horizon without burning out, we’ve got to be more like Bernard Lagat: Every now and then, we’ve got to take it really easy.
* In an attempt to minimize that possibility, Billingslea ensures he is already physically alert and psychologically zoned in when he first walks on stage. As a result, he enters the elusive zone more swiftly and predictably. He doesn’t wait for the zone to come to him. He creates it.
* Whereas positive moods were conducive to problem solving and creativity, negative moods inhibited these functions at a deep neurological level. This experiment is just one of many that demonstrates how it is hard to do your best thinking when your mind isn’t at peace.
* It’s also important to remember effect of mood on performance when evaluating yourself and your teammates or colleagues. 
* The latest science suggests it’s extremely hard to perform well at work if other elements of your life are not in harmony. 
* Be kind to yourself and others who are going through challenging times, and recognize that disconnecting “work” from “life” is an illusion.
* researchers found that subjects improved pattern recognition ability, a common indicator of general cognitive performance, by 37 percent after reading well-written prose.
* The lesson is, however, that your mental state preceding a performance can considerably affect it.
* When we create a space in which to practice our craft, it is beneficial to surround ourselves with objects that invite desired actions and eliminate ones that do not.

### A routine of good habits leads to flow - flow is the expression of talent
* “Don’t wait for the muse,” King writes in his memoir. “Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you are going to be every day from nine ’til noon or seven ’till three. If he knows,” King writes, “I assure you he’ll start showing up.”
* Skinner believed that nearly any trigger could elicit certain behaviors so long as the two (i.e., trigger and behavior) were consistently paired and positively reinforced.
* What Hamilton’s story adds is that an individualized routine goes beyond just priming us to work. It also alters our biology, changing our hormonal profile in a manner that increases strength, energy, confidence, creativity, attention, and memory. 
* In other words, developing a custom routine doesn’t just condition us to perform. It enhances the performance itself.
* If stress + rest = growth is the foundation upon which our talent is built, then our routines and environments help us to fully express that talent.
* He does, however, minimize distractions and eliminate activities that are extraneous to his work. This isn’t to say Joyner is narrow-minded, walled off in his own field.

### Mental minimalism - decrease decision fatigue by reducing decisions
* “I block off between 60 and 90 minutes every day to read outside of my domain,” he told us. “This helps me generate new ideas.” But Joyner only does this extensive reading because he identified creativity as something integral to his research, and reading broadly is one of his conduits to creativity. 
* He doesn’t expend time or energy on anything that is not critical to his mission. “In order to be a maximalist,” he says, “you have to be a minimalist.”
* Each time we make a deliberate decision, however inconsequential it may seem, our brain is processing different scenarios and evaluating all the options. As the decisions we make add up, so, too, does the amount of processing required by our brain. 
* Just like any other muscle would, our mental muscle gets tired.
* In addition to fatiguing us over the course of a day, making decisions, even small ones, interrupts our acute train of thought. Our brains must drop whatever they were currently stewing on (or, if our brains were in a creative mind-wandering state, they must switch out of it into an effortful thinking state) all just to evaluate what kind of socks we should wear.
* Become a minimalist to be a maximalist. 
* Reflect on all the decisions that you make throughout a day. Identify ones that are unimportant, that don’t really matter to you. 
* Automate as many of the decisions that don’t really matter as you can. Common examples include decisions about: Clothing What to eat at meals 
* In addition to eliminating as many decisions as possible, don’t devote brainpower to gossip, politics, or worrying about what others think of you.
* researchers have found larks perform best on tasks requiring creative insight in the evening, whereas owls tend to be most creative in the morning.

### A culture that inspires motivation
* It turns out the determining factor as to whether the 30 cadets within a squadron improved was the motivation of the least fit person in the group. 
* If the least fit person was motivated to improve, then his enthusiasm spread and everyone improved. If, on the other hand, the least fit person was apathetic or, worse, negative, he dragged everyone down. 
* Just like diseases easily spread through tight-knit groups, so does motivation. And it’s quite contagious.
* Plato noted, “What is honored in a country will be cultivated there.”
* Peter Drucker, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”
* Megan Gaurnier, “I cannot stress enough the importance of building a ‘village’ of the right personal and professional supporters—it’s everything.”

### Consistency 
* James Clear, “The single greatest skill in any endeavor is doing the work. Not doing the work that is easy for you. Not doing the work that makes you look good. Not doing the work when you feel inspired. Just doing the work.”
* The best performers are not consistently great, but they are great at being consistent. They show up every day and they do the work.
* When I’m in writing mode for a novel, I get up at 4 a.m. and work for 5 to 6 hours. In the afternoon, I run 4 kilometers or swim for 1,500 meters (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9 p.m. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.

### Pushing through limits - using purpose to break limits
* in ordinary circumstances the body shuts down well in advance of its limits. Fear, fatigue, and pain act as protective mechanisms.
* But in extraordinary situations, like when someone’s life is on the line, we are capable of overriding these defenses. We no longer feel fear, fatigue, or pain.
* Strecher discovered that throughout history, when people focus on a self-transcending purpose, or a purpose greater than themselves, they become capable of more than they ever thought was possible. 
* Strecher believes this is because when we concentrate deeply on something beyond ourselves, our ego is minimized. A large part of our ego’s role is to literally protect our “self.” It is our ego that tells us to shut down and flee when faced with threats. 
* When we transcend our “self” and minimize our ego, however, we can overcome the fears, anxieties, and physiological protective mechanisms that so often hold us back from achieving major breakthroughs. A whole new realm of possibilities emerges.
* It’s not that our muscles wear out; rather, it is our brain that shuts them down when they still have a few more percentage points to give.
* the brain comes in and creates a perception of failure before we actually harm ourselves.
* He later told us Pharr Davis’s experience on the Appalachian Trail is a profound example of ego minimization. He explained that she was harnessing the power of purpose to overcome her fears and doubts, and pointed us to new brain science that sheds light on what may have been unfolding inside her head.
* The individuals who reflected on their core values actually went on to overcome threats and fears in their lives at a much greater rate than a control group.
* purpose reduces burnout and even helps with adherence to challenging health behaviors like dieting or quitting smoking.
* It’s only when we transcend our “self” that we can break through our self-imposed limits.
* Our “ego” or “self” or “central governor” serves as a protective mechanism that holds us back from reaching our true limits. 
* When faced with great challenges, our ego is biologically programmed to shut us down, telling us to turn in the other direction. 
* By focusing on a self-transcending purpose, or a reason for doing something beyond our “self,” we can override our ego and break through our self-imposed limits. •To the extent you can, link your activities to a greater purpose

### Meaning and purpose improves motivation
* The janitors were constantly reminded that by keeping the hospital clean, they were minimizing the chance of bacteria spreading and harming the already vulnerable patients. They no longer saw their job as just removing vomit from the floors; they saw it as saving lives.
* Duckworth and her colleagues wrote in a 2014 paper, “Highly aversive experiences may become more bearable when they are viewed as having positive consequences that transcend the self.”
* In his book, Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl wrote, “A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.”
* We are constantly balancing perception of effort, or how hard something feels, with motivation. 
* If we want to endure more effort, which often leads to better performance, we may need to increase our motivation. 
* The best way to increase motivation is to link our work to a greater purpose or cause. 
* Not only will focusing on activities that help others make the world a better place, it will also make you a better performer. 
* Especially when we are feeling tired or worn out, we should think about why we are doing what we are doing. 
* the basic gist is that you should focus on helping others. Helping others activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. Not only does this make you feel better, but it also helps you re-associate positive emotions with your pursuit. 
* For these reasons, giving back often results in renewed energy and motivation. 
* Find opportunities to give back in the context of your work; these can be more intensive, such as coaching and mentoring, or less intensive, such as posting sincere advice in online forums. •The only criteria is that your “giving” is closely linked to your work and that you give without the expectation of getting anything back. 
* While “giving” is especially powerful for preventing and reversing burnout, you should still aim to avoid burnout by supporting stress with appropriate rest.


### Self talk
* There is widespread evidence that self-talk boosts performance.
* Self-talk is most effective when what we tell ourselves is short, specific, and, most important, consistent.
* is especially helpful in situations when our bodies and/or minds are telling us to quit, but we want to keep going.
* expressive writing, it’s when we reflect on our purpose in an effort to determine how closely we lived in accordance with it.
* In situations when you feel the sensation of stress, remind yourself that this is your body’s natural way of preparing for a challenge. Take a deep breath and channel the heightened arousal and sharper perception into the task at hand.
