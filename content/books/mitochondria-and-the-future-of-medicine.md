# Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine #

### The Key to Understanding Disease, Chronic Illness, Aging, and Life Itself ###

*Excerpts*

Typically, it’s prescribed in combination with other nutrients, in what’s often called the “mitochondrial cocktail,” and a knowledgeable and progressive doctor might recommend some or all of these supplements: creatine monohydrate, vitamin C, vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), L-carnitine, or L-arginine. Others include D-ribose, PQQ, magnesium, and medium-chain fatty acids.
Note:Supplements

Ribose supplementation resulted in a lower heart rate for a set amount of work on a stationary bike, improved diastolic function in the heart, increased exercise tolerance, and accelerated recovery

Researchers found PQQ not only protected mitochondria from oxidative damage, it also stimulated the growth of new mitochondria!

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled human clinical trial found that 20 milligrams of oral PQQ taken daily improved short-term memory, attention and concentration, information identification, and processing ability in healthy adults.

Research has shown that oil-based formulations (typically softgels) are much better absorbed, and water-dispersible liposomal or pre-emulsified formulations are even better. Ubiquinol (reduced CoQ10) seems to offer much better absorption than ubiquinone (oxidized CoQ10), and water-soluble (solubilized) ubiquinol is even better absorbed.

Where ALA surpasses other conventional antioxidants is that it is targeted to the mitochondria. Most other antioxidants can’t effectively concentrate at the level of the mitochondrion and so are almost meaningless in their ability to support the most important generator of free radicals.

Further, some exciting animal research has shown that supplementing the diet with ALA—especially when combined with acetyl-L-carnitine—can have profound antiaging benefits by restoring youthful activity levels, cognitive performance, and heart function.

Of nutritional supplements you will find on the market the body can only use one form, what we call the R(+) form. Many commercial ALA products are synthetic, and they contain the inactive S(-) isomer in equal parts to the biologically active R(+) isomer, which means you’re only getting 50 percent of the possible biological activity from the product. Also, ALA is not stable at room temperature for long. What happens is that elevated temperatures cause ALA molecules to polymerize (link together to form chains), and this form doesn’t seem to be absorbable. For this reason, a stabilized R(+) ALA product or one that is sold from the fridge (and stored in the fridge at home) is best.

Creatine is being studied as a nutritional therapy that might help with diseases affecting the neuromuscular system, such as muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and even ALS. Other studies suggest creatine might have therapeutic benefits for wasting syndromes and muscle atrophy in the aging population, fatigue and fibromyalgia, and some brain-related disorders.

A growing number of studies have found that creatine can protect the brain from neurotoxic agents and certain forms of brain injury. Studies have found creatine to be highly neuroprotective against various neurotoxic agents, including MPTP (a chemical that impairs energy production in brain cells and has been used in lab animals to induce Parkinson’s). Other studies found that creatine protected nerve cells from ischemia-related damage similar to what is often seen after a stroke. Impressive? The neurological benefits don’t stop there. As mentioned earlier, other studies have found that creatine can play a therapeutic or protective role in Huntington’s disease and ALS. Research is promising; all this could be just the tip of the iceberg.

Related to its role in energy metabolism and increased activity of mitochondria, interest is growing in the use of vitamin B3 for the treatment of neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cancers, and inflammation. Other benefits include increased fatty acid oxidation, resistance to the negative consequences of high-fat diets, antioxidant protection, prevention of peripheral neuropathy, and reduction of muscle degeneration.

The World Health Organization considers iron deficiency to be the largest international nutritional disorder.

A word of caution—and a critical one at that: Don’t supplement with iron unless you need to take iron according to a blood test. Too much iron can increase the free-radical burden within the body and lead to a number of health conditions.

One of the major benefits of resveratrol and pterostilbene is the ability to mimic many of the beneficial effects of calorie restriction (discussed in the following section in detail) by favorably regulating genes involved in the development of cancers, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and the systemwide inflammation that underlies a variety of age-related disorders.

Looking into at the moment, Gynostemma pentaphylum, seems to have powerful benefits for mitochondria by activating AMPK. G. pentaphylum has been shown to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce body fat and blood sugar, and modulate inflammation.
