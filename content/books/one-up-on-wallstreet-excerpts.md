But there’s a way to get something out of an annual report in a few minutes, which is all the time I spend with one.

The balance sheet lists the assets and then the liabilities. That’s critical to me.

In the top column marked Current Assets, I notice that the company has $5.672 billion in cash and cash items, plus $4.424 billion in marketable securities. Adding these two items together, I get the company’s current overall-cash position, which I round off to $10.1 billion. Comparing the 1987 cash to the 1986 cash in the right-hand column, I see that Ford is socking away more and more cash. This is a sure sign of prosperity.

Then I go to the other half of the balance sheet, down to the entry that says “long-term debt.” Here I see that the 1987 long-term debt is $1.75 billion, considerably reduced from last year’s long-term debt. Debt reduction is another sign of prosperity. When cash increases relative to debt, it’s an improving balance sheet. When it’s the other way around, it’s a deteriorating balance sheet.

The cash and cash assets alone exceed the debt by $8.35 billion. When cash exceeds debt it’s very favorable. No matter what happens, Ford isn’t about to go out of business.

First thing I want to know is what that product means to the company in question. What percent of sales does it represent? L’eggs sent Hanes stock soaring because Hanes was a relatively small company. Pampers was more profitable than L’eggs, but it didn’t mean as much to the huge Procter and Gamble.

The p/e ratio of any company that’s fairly priced will equal its growth rate.

If the p/e ratio is less than the growth rate, you may have found yourself a bargain. A company, say, with a growth rate of 12 percent a year (also known as a “12-percent grower”) and a p/e ratio of 6 is a very attractive prospect.

A slightly more complicated formula enables us to compare growth rates to earnings, while also taking the dividends into account. Find the long-term growth rate (say, Company X’s is 12 percent), add the dividend yield (Company X pays 3 percent), and divide by the p/e ratio (Company X’s is 10). 12 plus 3 divided by 10 is 1.5. Less than a 1 is poor, and 1.5 is okay, but what you’re really looking for is a 2 or better. A company with a 15 percent growth rate, a 3 percent dividend, and a p/e of 6 would have a fabulous 3.

A normal corporate balance sheet has two sides. On the left side are the assets (inventories, receivables, plant and equipment, etc.). The right side shows how the assets are financed. One quick way to determine the financial strength of a company is to compare the equity to the debt on the right side of the balance sheet.

If there’s enough cash to cover short-term debt, then you don’t have to worry about short-term debt.

It’s debt that determines which companies will survive and which will go bankrupt in a crisis. Young companies with heavy debts are always at risk.

I pay particular attention to the debt structure, as well as to the amount of the debt,

People invest in these on the theory that if the book value is $20 a share and the stock sells for $10, they’re getting something for half price. The flaw is that the stated book value often bears little relationship to the actual worth of the company. It often understates or overstates reality by a large margin. Penn Central had a book value of more than $60 a share when it went bankrupt!

Overvalued assets on the left side of the balance sheet are especially treacherous when there’s a lot of debt on the right. Let’s say that a company shows $400 million in assets and $300 million in debts, resulting in a positive book value of $100 million. You know the debt part is a real number. But if the $400 million in assets will bring only $200 million in a bankruptcy sale, then the actual book value is a negative $100 million. The company is less than worthless.

When you buy a stock for its book value, you have to have a detailed understanding of what those values really are. At Penn Central, tunnels through mountains and useless rail cars counted as assets.

Just as often as book value overstates true worth, it can understate true worth. This is where you get the greatest asset plays. Companies that own natural resources—such as land, timber, oil, or precious metals—carry those assets on their book at a fraction of the true value.

There are hidden assets when one company owns shares of a separate company—as Raymond Industries did with Teleco Oilfield Services. People close to either situation realized that Raymond was selling for $12 a share, and each share represented $18 worth of Teleco. By buying Raymond you were getting Teleco for minus $6. Investors who did their homework bought Raymond and got Teleco for minus $6, and investors who didn’t bought Teleco for $18. This sort of thing happens all the time.

Cash flow is the amount of money a company takes in as a result of doing business. All companies take in cash, but some have to spend more than others to get it.

A lot of people use the cash flow numbers to evaluate stocks. For instance, a $20 stock with $2 per share in annual cash flow has a 10-to-1 ratio, which is standard. A ten percent return on cash corresponds nicely with the ten percent that one expects as a minimum reward for owning stocks long term.

There’s no point getting bogged down in these calculations. But if cash flow is ever mentioned as a reason you’re supposed to buy a stock, make sure that it’s free cash flow that they’re talking about. Free cash flow is what’s left over after the normal capital spending is taken out. It’s the cash you’ve taken in that you don’t have to spend.

With a manufacturer or a retailer, an inventory buildup is usually a bad sign. When inventories grow faster than sales, it’s a red flag.

There are two basic accounting methods to compute the value of inventories, LIFO and FIFO. As much as this sounds like a pair of poodles, LIFO actually stands for “last in, first out,” and FIFO stands for “first in, and first out.” If Handy and Harman bought some gold thirty years ago for $40 an ounce, and yesterday they bought some gold for $400 an ounce, and today they sell some gold for $450 an ounce, then what is the profit? Under LIFO, it’s $50 ($450 minus $400), and under FIFO it’s $410 ($450 minus $40).

So what is the real bottom line? It’s the final number at the end of an income statement: profit after taxes.

There’s not much to be gained in comparing pretax profit margins across industries, since the generic numbers vary so widely.

What you want, then, is a relatively high profit-margin in a long-term stock that you plan to hold through good times and bad, and a relatively low profit-margin in a successful turnaround.

As soon as there’s a Wendy’s next door to every McDonald’s, the only way Wendy’s can grow is by winning over the McDonald’s customers.

The p/e ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company and for similar companies in the same industry.

Whether insiders are buying and whether the company itself is buying back its own shares. Both are positive signs.

The cash position. With $16 in net cash, I know Ford is unlikely to drop below $16 a share. That’s the floor on the stock.

Since you buy these for the dividends (why else would you own them?) you want to check to see if dividends have always been paid, and whether they are routinely raised. When possible, find out what percentage of the earnings are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a low percentage, then the company has a cushion in hard times.

FAST GROWERS - Investigate whether the product that’s supposed to enrich the company is a major part of the company’s business.

That the company has duplicated its successes in more than one city or town, to prove that expansion will work.

That few institutions own the stock and only a handful of analysts have ever heard of it. With fast growers on the rise this is a big plus.

What is the debt structure, and how long can it operate in the red while working out its problems without going bankrupt?

Understand the nature of the companies you own and the specific reasons for holding the stock. (“It is really going up!” doesn’t count.)

Big companies have small moves, small companies have big moves.

Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept can be replicated.

Be suspicious of companies with growth rates of 50 to 100 percent a year.

Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.

Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favor, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street.

When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with the superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.

Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.

Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares.

Insider buying is a positive sign, especially when several individuals are buying at once.

It’s only by sticking to a strategy through good years and bad that you’ll maximize your long-term gains.

A better strategy, it seems to me, is to rotate in and out of stocks depending on what has happened to the price as it relates to the story.

If a stalwart has gone up 40 percent—which is all I expected to get out of it—and nothing wonderful has happened with the company to make me think there are pleasant surprises ahead, I sell the stock and replace it with another stalwart I find attractive that hasn’t gone up.

Get out of situations in which the fundamentals are worse and the price has increased, and into situations in which the fundamentals are better and the price is down.

The best time to buy stocks will always be the day you’ve convinced yourself you’ve found solid merchandise at a good price.

If the market can’t tell you when to sell, then what can? No single formula could possibly apply. “Sell before the interest rates go up” or “sell before the next recession” would be advice worth following, if only we knew when these things would happen, but of course we don’t, and so these mottos become platitudes as well.

As it turns out, if you know why you bought a stock in the first place, you’ll automatically have a better idea of when to say good-bye to it.

One obvious sell signal is that inventories are building up and the company can’t get rid of them, which means lower prices and lower profits down the road.

If The Gap has stopped building new stores, and the old stores are beginning to look shabby, and your children complain that The Gap doesn’t carry acid-washed denim apparel, which is the current rage, then it’s probably time to think about selling.

Newer owners were buying Polaroid all the way down on the theory that it couldn’t go much lower, and many of them must have regretted that decision, because in fact Polaroid did go much lower. This great stock fell from $1431/2 to $141/8 in less than a year, and only then did “it can’t go much lower” turn out to be true. So much for the it-can’t-go-lower theory.

The point is that a lousy cheap stock is just as risky as a lousy expensive stock if it goes down.

It’s interesting to note that the professional short sellers, who profit on stocks that go down in price, usually take their positions nearer to the bottom than to the top. The short sellers like to wait until a company is so obviously foundering that bankruptcy is a certainty.

In my experience no downtrodden stock ever returns to the level at which you’ve decided you’d sell. In fact, the minute you say, “If it gets back to $10, I’ll sell,” you’ve probably doomed the stock to several years of teetering around just below $9.75 before it keels over to $4, on its way to falling flat on its face at $1.

In most cases it’s better to buy the original good company at a high price than it is to jump on the “next one” at a bargain price.

I know that the large potential return is attractive to many small investors who are dissatisfied with getting rich slow. Instead, they opt for getting poor quick.

Market declines are great opportunities to buy stocks in companies you like.

Trying to predict the direction of the market over one year, or even two years, is impossible.

To come out ahead you don’t have to be right all the time, or even a majority of the time. The biggest winners are surprises to me, and takeovers are even more surprising. It takes years, not months, to produce big results.

Stock prices often move in opposite directions from the fundamentals but long term, the direction and sustainability of profits will prevail.

Just because the price goes up doesn’t mean you’re right.

Buying a company with mediocre prospects just because the stock is cheap is a losing technique.
