* There’s an upper limit to how much time and effort we can invest. And the more depleted we get, the more our return on that effort dwindles.
* The lesson is similar to the one I’d always ascribed to: if you prioritize the most important things first, then there will be room in your life not only for what matters most but also for other things too. But do the reverse, and you’ll get the trivial things done but run out of space for the things that really matter.
* What could happen in your life if the easy but pointless things became harder and the essential things became easier? If the essential projects you’ve been putting off became enjoyable, while the pointless distractions lost their appeal completely? Such a shift would stack the deck in our favor. It would change everything. It does change everything.
* When our brains are at full capacity, everything feels harder. Fatigue slows us down. Outdated assumptions and emotions make new information harder to process.
* So the first step toward making things more effortless is to clear the clutter in our heads and our hearts.

### Keep it simple
* Perfectionism makes essential projects hard to start, self-doubt makes them hard to finish, and trying to do too much, too fast, makes it hard to sustain momentum.
* There are two types of results: linear and residual. Whenever your efforts yield a one-time benefit, you are getting a linear result.
* With residual results you put in the effort once and reap the benefits again and again.
* We’ve all experienced how the effortless way can feel. For example, have you ever been in a relaxed state and found it easier to get in “the zone”? stopped trying so hard and actually got better results? done something once that has benefited you multiple times?
* “If you keep it simple, less can go wrong,”
* The most important part of the process? “Not overthinking it. The biggest thing on the foul line is you can’t let too much get inside your head.”
* When faced with work that feels overwhelming, ask, “How am I making this harder than it needs to be?”

### Clear your head, prioritise the right thoughts
* When your brain is filled with clutter—like outdated assumptions, negative emotions, and toxic thought patterns—you have less mental energy available to perform what’s most essential.
* Because our brains are programmed to prioritize emotions with high “affective value”—like fear, resentment, or anger—these strong emotions will generally win out, leaving us with even fewer mental resources to devote to making progress on the things that matter.
* You can learn simple tactics to rid yourself of all the clutter slowing down the hard drive of your mind.

### It doesn't have to be hard, invert and make it simple
* “I could see it all for what it was: layers and layers of unnecessary complexity. I could see how it was expanding all the time and how I was suffocating underneath all of it.”
* It’s curious to me how we default to sayings like “It won’t be easy, but it’s worth it” or “It’s going to be really hard to make that happen, but we should try.” It’s like we all automatically accept that the “right” way is, inevitably, the harder one.
* Our survival as a species grows out of innate preference for taking the path of least effort.
* What if, instead of asking, “How can I tackle this really hard but essential project?,” we simply inverted the question and asked, “What if this essential project could be made easy?”
* As I reflected on how this had all gone so wrong, the answer was obvious. Nailing this presentation was so important to me, I had overthought it. I’d overengineered it. I’d tried too hard. And as a result, I’d snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.
* “One must invert, always invert.” 
* To invert means to turn an assumption or approach upside down, to work backward, to ask, “What if the opposite were true?” Inversion can help you discover obvious insights you have missed because you’re looking at the problem from only one point of view. It can highlight errors in our thinking.
* Asking the question “What if this could be easy?” is a way to reset our thinking. It may seem almost impossibly simple. And that’s exactly why it works.
* Free of the assumptions that make your problem look hard, you would be surprised how often an easier solution appears.
* We think that to be extraordinarily successful we have to do the things that are hard and complicated. Instead, we can look for opportunities that are highly valuable and simple and easy.
* The investment strategy at Berkshire Hathaway as “lethargy bordering on sloth. ”They are not looking to invest in companies that will require enormous effort to achieve profitability. They are looking for investments that are easy to say yes to: no-brainer businesses
* “I don’t look to jump over 7-foot bars: I look around for 1-foot bars that I can step over.”

### Make things enjoyable
* Why would we simply endure essential activities when we can enjoy them instead? By pairing essential activities with enjoyable ones, we can make tackling even the most tedious and overwhelming tasks more effortless.
* “There are many experiences in our work and personal life that are boring, mundane, or even stressful. We often feel that we have no options but to endure them or avoid them,” Culberson says. But “if we can break down the processes into those steps, we may find ways to make the steps more bearable, or better yet, fun.”
* Our rituals are habits we have put our thumbprint on. Our rituals are habits with a soul. They have the power to transform a tedious task into an experience that creates joy.
* Turn tedious tasks into meaningful rituals.

### Keep positive
* Have you ever found that the more you complain—and the more you read and hear other people complain—the easier it is to find things to complain about? On the other hand, have you ever found that the more grateful you are, the more you have to be grateful for?
* Positive emotions open us to new perspectives and possibilities. Our openness encourages creative ideas and fosters social bonds.
* When we experience negative emotions our mindset narrows (think: fight, flight, or freeze). We are less open to new ideas and to other people.
* Jim Collins uses the metaphor of a flywheel to illustrate how a self-sustaining system is created: “You’re pushing no harder than during the first rotation, but the flywheel goes faster and faster.”
* Use this habit recipe: “Each time I complain I will say something I am thankful for.”

### Let go of grudges
* After I complain I will say something I am thankful
* A good first step we can take is to ask this unusual question: What job have I hired this grudge to do?
* We often hire a grudge to fulfill an emotional need that is not currently being met.
* Grudges cost us resources but don’t deliver a satisfying return on our investment. So we must relieve a grudge of its duties.
* Sometimes we hire a grudge to make us feel in control. We try to prove to ourselves and others that we are right and they are wrong. At first this can make us feel superior, even powerful. It gives us a sense of control, but one that is fleeting and false, because in reality a grudge controls you.
* We can hire a grudge to get us off the hook. As long as we have someone to blame, we don’t have to take responsibility for our anger. We are granted implicit permission to wallow in the negativity we feel, without having to justify ourselves to anyone.
* “the best thing one can do when it is raining, is to let it rain.”
* When we let go of our need to punish those who’ve hurt us, it’s not the culprit who is freed. We are freed.


### Limit exertion to maintain consistency
* “To maximize gains from long-term practice,” the study’s lead author, K. Anders Ericsson, concluded, “individuals must avoid exhaustion and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on a daily or weekly basis.”
* Do not do more today than you can completely recover from today. Do not do more this week than you can completely recover from this week.
* Negative returns: the point where we are not merely getting a smaller return on each additional investment, we are actually decreasing our overall output. For example, there is a point in writing where you start making a manuscript worse by working on it longer.
* The goal is to accomplish what matters by trying less, not more: to achieve our purpose with bridled intention, not overexertion. This is what is meant by Effortless Action.

### Be present
* Distractions that keep us from being present in the moment can be like cataracts for our minds. They make noticing what matters harder.
* When we are fully present with another person, we see them more clearly. And we help them see themselves more clearly as well.
* We all have people in our lives who come to us because they are struggling to see a problem
* First, when people fear being judged, it drowns out their inner voice. They are able to focus only on what they think we want to hear, rather than on what they actually see or feel. Second, the moment our judgments and opinions are voiced, they compete for the limited mental space others need to draw their own conclusions.
* When someone in the community (the “focus person”) is facing an important dilemma, they often ask a few people they trust (the “Elders”) to come together to form a committee. The purpose is not for the committee to tell them what to do. The purpose is to help them figure it out for themselves. And in order to do this, the committee must remove judgment from the equation.
* “Each of us has an inner teacher, a voice of truth, that offers the guidance and power we need to deal with our problems.”
* The greatest gift we can offer to others is not our skill or our money or our effort. It is simply us.
* Let go of emotional burdens you don’t need to keep carrying.
* The Effortless State is an experience many of us have had when we are physically rested, emotionally unburdened, and mentally energized. You are completely aware, alert, present, attentive, and focused on what’s important in this moment. You are able to focus on what matters most with ease. INVERT Instead of asking, “Why is this so hard?,” invert the question by asking, “What if this could be easy?” Challenge the assumption that the “right” way is, inevitably, the harder one. Make the impossible possible by finding an indirect approach.
* Remember: When you focus on what you lack, you lose what you have. When you focus on what you have, you get what you lack.
* To see others more clearly, set aside your opinions, advice, and judgment, and put their truth above your own.

### Get into an effortless state
* If you try too hard when shooting a free throw, you’ll tense up and move too fast. This is similar to what happens to many overachievers who have been conditioned to believe that more effort leads to better outcomes. When they invest a lot of effort and don’t see the results they want, they lean in harder. They work longer hours.
* Past a certain point, more effort doesn’t produce better performance. It sabotages our performance.

### What does 'done' mean? 
* And so the most expensive naval project in Sweden’s history sailed less than a mile before being buried in the sea—all because the king had made the project almost impossible to safely complete by constantly redefining what “done” looked like.
* If you want to make something hard, indeed truly impossible, to complete, all you have to do is make the end goal as vague as possible.
* But to get an important project done it’s absolutely necessary to define what “done” looks like.
* Sometimes important projects remain undone because we keep tinkering with them endlessly.
* Getting clear on what “done” looks like doesn’t just help you finish; it also helps you get started. All too often, we procrastinate or struggle to take the first steps on a project because we don’t have a clear finish line in mind.
* “Launch my product.” Have ten beta users try the app for a week and give feedback.

### Take the first step, the minimum viable product (MVP)
* The concept was big—huge really. It was long term and ambitious. The cofounders knew what “done” looked like—the massive global streaming service and content library Netflix is today—but instead of mapping out a complex, detailed plan to get there, Hastings and Randolph looked for the ridiculously simple first step that would inform them whether they should take a second step or just walk away. Mailing that single disk turned out to be the simplest, most obvious way to set their immense idea in motion.
* You don’t have to be overwhelmed by essential projects. Often, when you name the first obvious step, you avoid spending too much mental energy thinking about the fifth, seventh, or twenty-third steps. It doesn’t matter if your project involves ten steps or a thousand. When you adopt this strategy, all you have to focus on is the very first step.
* Such is the power of taking the first, concrete, physical step: it ignites a subsequent surge of focused Effortless Action.
* Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, defines a minimum viable product as “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.”
* Start with a ten-minute microburst of focused activity to boost motivation and energy.

### Minimise the number of steps
* Suddenly I could see it: we were making this process so much more complicated than it had to be. By adding so many steps—even if just mentally—we were making it harder for ourselves to take any steps at all. So we took a step back and asked, “What are the minimum steps required to complete this?”
* What are the minimum steps required for completion?
* Unnecessary steps are just that: unnecessary. Eliminating them allows you to channel all your energy toward getting the important project done.
* Being asked to do X isn’t a good enough reason to do Y.
* They had started with an immensely complicated product and attempted to pare it down. But Jobs came at it from the opposite angle. He started at zero and tried to figure out the absolute minimum number of steps required to achieve the desired outcome.
* One of the twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto states, “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.” By this they mean that the goal is to create value for the customer, and if this can be done with less code and fewer features, that is exactly what ought to be done.
* We should focus on only those steps that add value.
* To simplify the process, don’t simplify the steps: simply remove them.

### Build quick, test and iterate
* The real challenge wasn’t to build an elegant aircraft that could do the figure eight on the field around the two pylons; it was to build a large, light aircraft, “no matter how ugly it is,” that you could crash, “then repair, modify, alter, redesign—fast.” That was when he suddenly realized, “There is an easy way to do it.”
* That accident would have kept those [other larger, more sophisticated teams] from flying for something like six months. So we got a huge amount of flight experience out of this.”
* His most brilliant insight wasn’t some advanced breakthrough in the science of flight. It was simply that focusing on the elegance and sophistication of the aircraft was actually an impediment to progress. An ugly aircraft that could be crashed, repaired, and redesigned fast would make it much easier to make progress on what really mattered:

### Perfect is the enemy of good, mistakes are a great teacher
* Overachievers tend to struggle with the notion of starting with rubbish; they hold themselves to a high standard of perfection at every stage in the process. But the standard to which they hold themselves is neither realistic nor productive.
* many people cite learning a new language as an essential project, a dream that matters to them. But they never practice because they are embarrassed. They want to be flawless
* The faster they make those mistakes, the faster they will progress.
* We want to find ways to experience—and learn from—failure as cheaply as possible.
* “If you’re not embarrassed by your first product release,” he says, “you released it too late.” Or put another way, “When it comes to product launches, imperfect is perfect.”
* "A life spent in making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.”

### Zero draft, start with crap
* When you start a project, start with rubbish.
* I recommend they adopt a “zero-draft” approach. That is, write a version of that first chapter that’s so rough it wouldn’t even qualify as a first draft. The idea with the zero draft is to write anything. The more rubbish the better.
* “When I am writing, I write. And then it’s as if the muse is convinced I’m serious and says ‘Okay. Okay. I’ll come.’”
* “A word after a word after a word is power.” Even rubbish words are more powerful than a blank page.

### Slow and steady, consistency and longevity
* Slow Is Smooth, Smooth Is Fast
* Set an effortless pace: slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
* Without particular effort? They accomplished a feat that had eluded adventurers for millennia. Of course, not every day was easy. But even under the harshest of conditions, the goal was doable, thanks to that one simple rule: they would not exceed fifteen miles a day, no matter what.
* When we’re trying to achieve something that matters to us, it’s tempting to want to sprint out of the gate. The problem is that going too fast at the beginning will almost always slow us down the rest of the way. 
* We feel exhausted on the days we sprint hard, drained and demoralized on the days we don’t, and more often than not we wind up like those British explorers, feeling battered and broken and still no closer to achieving our goal.
* Holding back when you still have steam in you might seem like a counterintuitive approach to getting important things done, but in fact, this kind of restraint is key to breakthrough productivity.
* Less experienced infantry, he says, “will often zealously sprint into battle and give the impression of momentum.” The problem with this approach is that as soon as they are in danger they will have to sprint to take cover at the first chance they get, and may end up in a place they haven’t had time to survey or assess
* When you go slow, things are smoother. You have time to observe, to plan, to coordinate efforts. But go too slow and you may get stuck or lose your momentum.
* Create the right range: I will never do less than X, never more than Y.
* Effortless Results: not to achieve a result once through intense effort, but to effortlessly achieve a result again and again.


### Leverage your effort
* An employee who works an hour and gets paid for that hour has a linear income.
* An entrepreneur who makes money only when she is actively working to make it happen has a linear business model.
* Residual results are completely different. With residual results you exert effort once and reap the benefits again and again.
* An author who writes a book and is paid royalties for years is getting residual income.
* A mother who delegates a whole chore to her child and makes it fun, so it happens every day without prodding, is practicing residual parenting.
* Personal capability compounds over time.
* You establish a habit once, but then it serves you for a lifetime.

### Teaching, automation and being proactive
* Teach others to teach, and you get exponential impact.
* Automate something once, and then forget about it as it continues to work perpetually.
* Solving a problem before it happens can save you endless time and aggravation later on.
* Write bad code, and users will be frustrated again and again.

### Learning
* When you understand why something happened or how something works, you can apply that knowledge again and again.
* Many people assume that Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has a background in mechanical engineering and rocket science. But he actually didn’t know much about either subject when he started these ventures.
* “It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”
* Learning something new is often a series of attempts, failures, and adjustments. Neural connections that result in success are reinforced and grow stronger.
* Munger’s approach to investing and life is the pursuit of what he calls “worldly wisdom.” He believes that by combining learnings from a range of disciplines—psychology, history, mathematics, physics, philosophy, biology, and more—we produce something that is greater than the sum of its parts. Munger sees isolated facts as useless unless they “hang together on a latticework of theory.”
* A business raises the price of its product, yet sells more of that product. This does not make sense if you consider only the discipline of economics and its rule of supply and demand. But if you also consider the discipline of psychology, you understand that buyers think that a higher price means higher quality and therefore buy more.
* Munger is wise to “believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out.”
* “I don’t believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody’s that smart.”
* Reading a book is among the most high-leverage activities on earth.
* Read the classics and the ancients.
* Read to Absorb (Rather Than to Check a Box).

### Knowledge as leverage
* Distill to Understand. When I finish reading a book, I like to take ten minutes to summarize what I learned from it on a single page in my own words.
* Being good at what nobody is doing is better than being great at what everyone is doing.
* To reap the residual results of knowledge, the first step is to leverage what others know. But the ultimate goal is to identify knowledge that is unique to you, and build on it.
* An entrepreneur with a great reputation will have investor capital flow to them again and again.
* Gaining unique knowledge takes time, dedication, and effort. But invest in it once, and you’ll attract opportunities for the rest of your life.

### Teaching
* Teaching others is also an accelerated way to learn.
* We focus more intently. We listen to understand. We think about the underlying logic so we can put the ideas into our own words.
* If you try to teach people everything about everything, you run the risk of teaching them nothing. You will achieve residual results faster if you clearly identify—then simplify—the most important messages you want to teach others to teach.
* These messages should be not just easy to understand but also hard to misunderstand.
* Don’t go for the overly sophisticated message. Don’t go for the one that makes you sound smart. Go for the straightforward message that can be easily understood and repeated.

### Checklists simplify the process and remove extra thinking
* “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations we can perform without thinking about them”
* “As many essential steps and activities as possible should be automated.”
* The beauty of the checklist is that the thinking has been done ahead of time. It’s been taken out of the equation. Or rather, it has been baked into the equation. So instead of getting these essential things right occasionally, we get them right every time.
* Of course, this is just a partial list. The idea of a cheat sheet is simply to get things out of your brain so you can do them automatically, without having to rely on memory.

### Relationships in business
* When you have trust in your relationships, they take less effort to maintain and manage.
* The speed and quality of decisions go up. Political infighting goes down.
* When you have low trust on teams, everything is hard. Just sending a text or an email is exhausting as you weigh up every word for how it might be taken. When the response comes back you may experience a jolt of anxiety. Every conversation feels like it’s a grind.
* The best way to leverage trust to get residual results is simply to select trustworthy people to be around.
* Steve admits, “My mistake was even worse than hiring someone I didn’t trust. I hired her, she lost my trust, and I continued to have her stay on long after she lost my trust.”
* Warren Buffett uses three criteria for determining who is trustworthy enough to hire or to do business with. He looks for people with integrity, intelligence, and initiative, though he adds that without the first, the other two can backfire.
* When you can say these four little words, “I trust your judgment”—and mean them—it’s like magic. Team members feel empowered. They take a risk. They grow. Trust is strengthened. And then it tends to spread.

### Delegation
* As the vacancy creates a short-term headache. But while hiring quickly may lighten the load at first, hiring well will lighten the load consistently and repeatedly, saving you many more headaches in the long run.
* What is a problem that irritates me repeatedly? What is the total cost of managing that over several years? What is the next step I can take immediately, in a few minutes, to move toward solving it?
* Henry David Thoreau once wrote, “There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.” When we’re merely managing a problem, we’re hacking at the branches. To prevent the problem before it even arises, we should strike at the root.
