### Snippets

* Snippets are the quick little blurb / answer you'll often find as the top result for your Google search.
* Google can then pull detail from the page itself.
* Bold snippet, Google will value bolded statements more highly.
* Tee up 'answer target'. 'Figuring out how much to make can be hard, here's how'.
* If showing data in table, caption table and give descriptive and obvious column names.
* Make it useful and easy for readers.
