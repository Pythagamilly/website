* We are living through a revolution because of the pandemic. 
* Revolutions destroy the 'perfect' and enable the impossible. We are all living virtually now.
* 'Perfect' - means you play the game and you're winning well enough to play the game. Telegraph was perfect before the telephone. People dealing with perfect usually say 'no' to the new technology. Yahoo had a chance to buy Google for 10 mil.
* Management is not the same as leadership. Management is making things a little big better, cheaper in a reliable way.
* Leadership is voluntary, you can choose to lead or choose to follow. Leadership is voluntarily signing up to change the game. Leadership 'might not work'. If you're sure it's going to work then it is management.
* Leadership is exploring the edges, finding problems and solving them.
* Resistance is our fear of being wrong, our fear of change.
* Leaders want to change the game.
* On a good day, what happened because you went to work? If you are watching this, you are in a position which has leverage.
* A good day is a day you make change happen. Who are you seeking to change?
* Are you 'enrolled' in the journey.
* Most people who do Udemy courses do not finish them. There's no prize to finish - they feel good because they paid the money to watch the videos. 
* 'Enrolled' so frustrated with lack of forward motion that it's as if you're not being paid on time.
* Gradual changes and shifts in the culture end up leading to the long term transformation that we seek.
* Where is the authority, who will let me do this? This is not leadership. We are afraid of responsibility. Authority is hard to find, responsibility is easy to get.
* Decide you want to change the game. Choose your project and that will change your future.
* Choose your project choose your future. Seth missed the Internet, he thought it wouldn't work.
* Jugglers are good at catching the ball.
* Juggling has nothing to do with catching, it has to do with throwing. Get good at throwing.
* Get comfortable with the ball dropping to the ground, then you'll get good at throwing.
* Most people spend all the time getting good at trying to catch.
* Relentless curiosity.
* Agility doesn't mean you always land. When you're wrong you're still in the game.
* Do work that matters for people who care.
* People often know the solution to the problem, they just don't like the cost.
* Your boss won't let you do something big and new because if you succeed you'll take responsibility and if you fail your boss takes the blame.
  * Don't ask for permission, just make small changes to improve things and if it fails take the blame and if it succeeds give away responsibility
* Discover what works and what doesn't. It requires us to take responsibility. Do small beneficial and brave acts.
* If you chose your projects you chose your future. How can I choose?
