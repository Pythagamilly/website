## Writing
* Write blog posts about specific issues in your industry that people are interested in (right now).
* Write catchy headlines.
* Listen to feedback and questions from users.
* Consider your audience and the actions you want them to take.
* Speak to your audiences goals, pains and challenges.
* Define your buyer persona - what matters to them, their pains.
* Write in a conversational style, don't be too stiff.
* Write in a style that is effortless to read.
* Get rid of jargon, talk like real people talk.
* Keep touching upon the main point of the article and drive it home (in small ways).
* Keep your topics specific and not too broad. e.g. 'Business best practices'.
* More specific topics tend to get more targeted audiences.
* Tie your specific topic into the broader goal (e.g. one specific topic on WACC ties into the goal of educating the reader on how to value invest).
  * What will they gain by taking action?
* Structure your blog with an overall outline and section headers.
  * Different post styles will have a different structure (tutorial vs list).
  * Outline (template) to organise your thoughts.
  * Come up with a list of top take-aways. Break up take-aways into sub-headings.
* When you finish the article ask yourself 'can the reader now implement what I have tried to teach them?'
* Use data, evidence and references to back up your points.
* Do not plagiarize, apart from anything else it will impact your Google rankings.
  * Instead you give credit to the original author. 
* Proof read.
* Publish (after good editing and proof reading of course), but the update it in the future if there are more improvements.
* Publish consistently <look into what are the better schedules for SEO>.
* Schedule article release to be consistent if need be.
* The ROI of the blog is organic traffic over time.
  * Try to write 'evergreen' posts, that are relevant for a long time.
* Put a call to action and build a subscriber list. Current readers will give you an 'initial surge' of traffic.
* Update old posts. Updating old posts will show Google that your content is evolving and still relevant.
* Use different mediums to spread the same message (Video / Podcasts). This gives you more reach but you're practically saying the same thing so it helps your content stretch further.
* Don't write intros like a high school essay.


## SEO
* Target popular keywords using tools like Ahrefs, Moz or SEMrush.
* Email outreach to influencers.
* Write guest posts.
  * Find blogs you'd like to write for.
  * Check domain authority and contact those sites with high authority.
* Get people to link to you (creating backlinks).
  * Create content specifically for the people you want to link to you.
  * Link to websites on the post, make them look good and reach out to them and ask for a backlink.
* Quality over quantity. Better to have 1 good post a month than 10 crappy posts per week.
* Internal linking - one article linking to others. Good for SEO and also helps readers navigate to other content on your site.
* Social media - 
  * It's not just about pushing out posts and hoping for engagement. It's not an RSS feed.
  * After you post, tag relevant people in it.
  * To get social engagement you have to engage in social media.
* Create amazing images
  * Tools, [canva](https://www.canva.com/), [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/). 
  * Create charts / graphs.
* Add videos to your page.
  * Adding videos increases the users time-on-page which is good for SEO.
  * You can create animated videos by paying people (use Fiverr or People Per Hour etc.).
* Improve load times, Google ranks pages higher if their load times are better.
  * Optimize images, use lazy-loading. 
* User competitors keywords. Use an SEO tool and plug in your competitors URL and see what they're ranking for.
  * Use their keywords and write something better.

## Marketing
* Use a 'lead magnet', e.g. create a PDF of your post and offer it via an email signup.
  * e.g.2. download a cheatsheet for the post.
* Call to action.
  * Ask your reader to share your post.
  * Ask reader to subscribe to a newsletter.
  * Ask them to check out your app.
* Reach out to influencers.
  * (Influencer database)[https://influence.co/]
* Networking
  * Join slack groups and help people out.
  * Share other bloggers content.
* Build email lists and send your articles to them (i.e. from the call to action).
* Use your audience to pick topics.
  * Get topic ideas from questions on sites like Reddit and Quora. 
  * Read comments left on your blog.
  * Use Buzzsumo to find common questions on your topic.
* Share your post in niche forums (like Reddit and Quora).
* Join social media groups related to the topic you blog about.
* Write a compelling about page. People want to read stuff from people they can relate to and connect with.
* Paid advertising - think about using paid advertising on social media, make sure to have a call-to-action and measure the conversion rate on each ad.
* Give away your best content for free. It attracts users.
