### Market Research

* Have a look at competitor app reviews.
* Why would users be interested in this app?
* Unique selling point.
* How to reach target audience.
* Best time to launch app.

### Competitor research:
* Who they are.
* What are their unique selling points.
* Where are they successful / unsuccessful. 
* How are we different?
* Use their app and see what the experience is like.
* Are they actively improving their app? Check update schedule.

### Define success metrics
* We need measurable metrics to gauge success.
* Active install rate - number of people that install the app who then do not uninstall.
* Number of ratings received as well as over-all ratings.
* Compare ratings to average of competitors.
* Use analytics to track app usage.
* Keep an eye on ranking metrics over time.
* Return on app spend.

### Create content
* Create landing page.
* Write blogs on topics related to the app.
* Create press releases.
* Social media posts.
* Respond to any social media comments.
* Record demos on app use.

### App store / website SEO
* Create beautiful screenshots and demo of app.
* **Create promo video**
* Use good keywords.
* Ranking is governed by:
  * Keyword usage in description.
  * Visuals and branding.
  * Number of downloads.
  * Number of positive reviews.
* See what wording competitors use, speak language of audience.

### Exposure
* Network with complimentary app developers. Try and get a mutually beneficial co-marketing deal. e.g. a stock listing app can team up with a broker. Make sure you team up with a good app / developer.
* Pitch app to bloggers. Make sure app is available for them to use, also have a good video demo of its use.
* Landing page:
  * About page, screenshots and video demo.
  * Capture email.
  * Call to action => direct to app.
  * Blog.
* Media:
  * Search google for competitor products and contact bloggers who talk about those products.
  * Reverse google search images of competitor apps and see which blogs they are on.
  * HARO: Help-a-reporter-out connects bloggers with experts.
* Contact blogger tips:
  * Follow on Twitter.
  * Send them a couple of tweets.
  * Comment on their blogs.
  * Share their blog posts.
  * Email them with the 'ask' for them to comment / review / share.
* Social:
  * Watch for influencers who promote similar types of apps.
* Create a press kit:
  * App logo, screenshots and promo video.
  * Description / blurb.
  * Link to app and social media accounts.
  * Contact information.

### Social
* Claim social media tags for your app name.
* Create social sharing buttons with each press release.
* Contact influencers and thought leaders.

### Advertising
* Google Adwords.
* Facebook ads.
* Create affiliate program to encourage downloads.

### Beta
* Invite only beta to create an air of exclusivity. 
* Fix bugs before it is released to the public.
* Create feedback mechanism within app.

### The Pitch
When we contact an influencer / blogger. Here are some techniques.
* 1-2 sentence description of who I am, how we found them and why they might be interested.
* 1-2 sentence describing app including use case.
* Link to press kit.
* Offer beta access.
* Call to action - ask nicely and tell them exactly what they can do.

### After launch
* Monitor feedback, reviews and social media.
* Engage existing users to keep them engaged.
* Encourage rating and reviews.
* Ask only loyal users to rate your app (those who have launched it a number of times).
* Monitor app store rank and other analytics.
* Fix bugs reported by users. Beware that each update may reset the rating so lump as many fixes together as possible.
* Incentivise continued usage:
  * Game-ify usage.
  * Prizes, in-app achievements. 
* Encourage referrals:
  * Make app easy to share.
  * Give app referral bonuses.
